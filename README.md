Power BI dashboard for HR Data Analysis

In this project, I utilized Power BI to analyze and visualize key HR metrics. I imported and cleaned data using Power Query, created custom HR metrics (e.g., headcount, average leave balance, and salary) with Power Pivot, and added new data columns like employee age group. I explored relationships between salary and education level, applied visual filters to highlight top/bottom paid staff, and customized visuals for clear insights. Additionally, I used advanced DAX calculations, such as cumulative headcount and leave balances over 20 days, to design a dynamic monthly HR dashboard.
